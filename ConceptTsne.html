<p>The Dimensionality Reduction algorithm <a href='https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/'>t-SNE</a> (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) can be thought of as an extension of PCA, that attempts to identify patterns and not just components. There are two major approaches for achieving this</p><ul><li>Local approaches : They maps nearby points on the manifold to nearby points in the low dimensional representation.</li><li>    Global approaches : They attempt to preserve geometry at all scales, i.e. mapping nearby points on manifold to nearby points in low dimensional representation as well as far away points to far away points.</li></ul><p>Essentially, it calculates the probability similarity of points in high dimensional as well as low dimensional spaces. Then, it tries to minimize the gap between the two. Thus, it tries to put together points that were together in high dimensional space. That is essentially what we need in dimensionality reduction.</p><p>Understanding the concept is the major task - Python code is not a big deal</p><pre><code class='python'>from sklearn.manifold import TSNE 
tsne = TSNE(n_components=3, n_iter=300).fit_transform(df[feat_cols][:6000].values)</code></pre>
