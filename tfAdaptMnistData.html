<p>The next step is to alter the available data to make it more suitable for training the model.</p><p>The image data is naturally two dimensional. That may be very good for viewing graphics. But, for training a neural network, we need single dimensional records. This requires "flattening" the data. Keras provides us easy ways to flatten the data within the model. But for generic preprocessing, it is much better to flatten it right away. TensorFlow also provides for that.</p><pre><code class='python'>train_images = train_images.reshape(-1,784)
test_images = test_images.reshape(-1,784)</code></pre><p>The labels that we have are in terms of numbers 0-9. But, as an output of a neural network, these values have no numerical sequence. That is, 1 is less than 9. But when we read the images, this relation is not significant at all. The numerical relation between these outputs is just incidental. For the application, they are just 10 different labels. They are categorical output.</p><p>To work with this, we need to map the labels into 10 different independent arrays of 1's and 0's. We need to map each label to an array of 10 binary numbers - 0 for all and 1 for the specific value. For example, 1 will be mapped to [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]; 8 will be mapped to [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] and so on. That is called "Categorical" output.</p><pre><code class='python'>test_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(test_labels)
train_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(train_labels)</code></pre><p>Another very important task is to normalize the data. The activation functions - relu or sigmoid or tanh.. all of them work optimally when the numbers are less than 1. This an important step in any neural network. Missing this step has a very bad impact on the model efficiency.</p><pre><code class='python'>train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0</code></pre><p>This is very simple but important step in training a neural network.</p>
