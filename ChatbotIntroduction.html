<p>A chatbot is an interesting and easy application of deep learning. What exactly is a chatbot? Have you wondered how a child learns his mother-tongue? Does anyone go around teaching him the grammar, or structure of sentences, or does he have to go through the dictionary to understand each and every word of the language?</p><p>He may do these things later, to refine what he has learnt. But, most of the learning is merely by observing the conversations around him. Each conversation around is subconsciously recorded and the child learns and generalizes patterns from them. The same reflects in what he speaks.</p><p>The child takes a couple of years, but a machine can do this in minutes. Such an application is called a chatbot. It is trained by feeding in a huge chunk of conversations, and the bot learns a correspondence between question-answer pairs in a conversations. It develops a model which is later used to respond to queries.</p><p>That was the very basic concept put in simple words. But the question is, how do we generate a meaningful model from a bunch of conversations? One can intuitively understand that we will need RNN/LSTM for implementing such a model - because of the nature of the problem at hand. The model should be such that it generates the response for the given input. So it should be trained using the question/response pairs.  But how do we generate this model? How should we layout the network? That is not so simple! Years of research have given us a sturdy template that we can use to train the chatbot model based on the available data.</p>
