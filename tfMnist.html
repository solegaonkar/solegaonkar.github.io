<p>To share a brief introduction to the basic ideas, we can look into an implementation of a simple problem. MINST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) gives a good dataset for of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. We can use this to train a neural network - and build a model that can read and decode handwritten digits.</p><p>This problem is often called the "Hello World" of Deep Learning. Of course, we need a lot more for developing "real" applications. This is good to give you an introduction to the topic. Of course, there is a lot more to TensorFlow. If you are interested in a detailed study, you can take up an online course.</p><h3>Load Data</h3><hr/><p>The first step is to load the available data. TensorFlow provides us with a good set of test datesets that we can use for learning and testing. The MINST dataset is also available in these. So the job of fetching the training and test data is quite simple in this case. In real life problems, accumulating, cleaning and loading such data is a major part of the work. Here we do it in just one line of code.</p><pre><code class='python'>(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()</code></pre><p>This gives us four Tensors - train_images, train_labels, test_images and test_labels. The load_data() method itself takes care of splitting the available data into the train and test sets. In a real life problem, we have to do this ourselves. But, for the example code, we can utility methods available along with the TensorFlow dataset.</p><h3>Check the Data</h3><hr/><p>As a best practice, one should always take a peek at the data available.</p><pre><code class='python'>train_images.shape
...
(60000, 28, 28)</code></pre><pre><code class='python'>train_labels.shape
...
(60000,)</code></pre><pre><code class='python'>test_images.shape
...
(10000, 28, 28)</code></pre><pre><code class='python'>test_labels.shape
...
(10000,)</code></pre><p>We know that we are working on an image classification problem. So let us try to check out how these images look.</p><pre><code class='python'>plt.figure()
plt.imshow(train_images[0])
plt.colorbar()
plt.grid(False)</code></pre><div class='center'><img src='img/tf_mnist_5.png' /></div><p>There is a lot that we can do in this stage. But it makes very little sense for a data  like this that is already cleaned and sanitized.</p>
