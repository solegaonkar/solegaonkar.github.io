It extracts insights about contents of a given UTF-8 text file without the any special pre-processing. It develops insights by recognizing the entities, key phrases, language, sentiments, and other common elements in a document.</p><p>We can use Amazon Comprehend to create products based on understanding the structure of documents. We can search social networking feeds for information, or scan an entire document repository for key phrases, or determine the topics contained in a set of documents. We can also use it to extract insights from clinical documents such as doctorâ€™s notes or clinical trial reports.</p><p>Comprehend Medical is a new service that can detect useful information from an unstructured clinical text - physician's notes, discharge summaries, test results, case notes, and so on. Comprehend Medical uses Natural Language Processing models to leverage the latest advances in machine learning to sort through this enormous quantity of data and retrieve valuable information that would require significant manual effort.</p><p>Python code that detects the various entities in a given text string looks like this</p><pre><code class='python'>import boto3
client = boto3.client('comprehend')
response = client.batch_detect_entities(
    TextList=[
