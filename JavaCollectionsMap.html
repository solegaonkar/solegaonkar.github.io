<p>Java provides several implementations of the Map Interface - each tailored for a particular design requirement</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/jar/Attributes.html'>Attributes</a></h3><hr/><p>The Attributes class maps Manifest attribute names to associated string values. Valid attribute names are case-insensitive, are restricted to the ASCII characters in the set and cannot exceed 70 characters in length. Attribute values can contain any characters and will be UTF8-encoded when written to the output stream. See the JAR File Specification for more information about valid attribute names and values.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html'>ConcurrentHashMap</a></h3><hr/><p>This class provides a hash table with full concurrency of retrievals and high expected concurrency for updates. Although all operations are thread-safe, retrieval operations do not entail locking, and there is no support for locking the entire table in a way that prevents all access. Retrieval operations (including get) generally do not block, so may overlap with update operations (including put and remove). Retrievals reflect the results of the most recently completed update operations holding upon their onset. (More formally, an update operation for a given key bears a happens-before relation with any (non-null) retrieval for that key reporting the updated value.) Ofcourse it is Thread Safe.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListMap.html'>ConcurrentSkipListMap</a></h3><hr/><p>This class provides a scalable concurrent ConcurrentNavigableMap implementation. The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is used. Iterators and spliterators are weakly consistent. Ascending key ordered views and their iterators are faster than descending ones. All Map.Entry pairs returned by methods in this class and its views represent snapshots of mappings at the time they were produced. They do not support the Entry.setValue method. (Note however that it is possible to change mappings in the associated map using put, putIfAbsent, or replace, depending on exactly which effect you need.) The bulk operations putAll, equals, toArray, containsValue, and clear are not guaranteed to be performed atomically. For example, an iterator operating concurrently with a putAll operation might view only some of the added elements.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/EnumMap.html'>EnumMap</a></h3><hr/><p>This class provides a specialized Map with enum type keys. All of the keys in an enum map must come from a single enum type (could be anonymous). Enum maps are extremely compact and efficient because they are internally represented as arrays. Enum maps are maintained in the natural order of their keys (the order in which the enum constants are declared). This is reflected in the iterators returned by the collections views (keySet(), entrySet(), and values()). It is Not Thread Safe Iterators returned by the collection views are weekly consistent: they will never throw ConcurrentModificationException and they may or may not show the effects of any modifications to the map that occur while the iteration is in progress.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html'>HashMap</a></h3><hr/><p>This class provides the most commonly used implementation of the Map interface. Its owes its effeciency to the use of Hashcode for organizing the data. It is Not Thread Safe. No guarantees can be made about its behavior when multiple threads access it concurrently.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html'>LinkedHashMap</a></h3><hr/><p>This class provides a combination of Hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface. Its iterators have a predictable order. It maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map (insertion-order). It is Not Thread Safe. No guarantees can be made about its behavior when multiple threads access it concurrently.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html'>Hashtable</a></h3><hr/><p>This class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Although it is declared as Thread Safe, its use is discouraged by the JDK documentation - because it is part of legacy code, and just retrofitted to match the Map interface.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html'>Properties</a></h3><hr/><p>This class provides a set of properties. It is Thread Safe. It provides good functionality to persist into a file - as XML or as key value pairs. Hence it is often used for maintaing configurable information.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/IdentityHashMap.html'>IdentityHashMap</a></h3><hr/><p>This class implements the Map interface with a hash table, using reference-equality in place of object-equality when comparing keys (and values). This is not a general-purpose Map implementation! It is designed for use only in the rare cases wherein reference-equality semantics are required. It is Not Thread Safe.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html'>TreeMap</a></h3><hr/><p>This class implements the NavigableMap. It is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is used. It is Not Thread Safe.</p><h3><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html'>WeakHashMap</a></h3><hr/><p>This class provides a Hash table based implementation of the Map interface, with weak keys. An entry in a WeakHashMap will automatically be removed when its key is no longer in ordinary use. More precisely, the presence of a mapping for a given key will not prevent the key from being discarded by the garbage collector. It is Not Thread Safe. This is useful when you have several transactions on the map and you do not need the data after some time. The WeakHashMap will take care of discarding things for you.</p>
