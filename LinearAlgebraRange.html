<p>The span of something refers to the extent of its capacity. The span of a set of vectors {x<sub>1</sub>, . . . x<sub>n</sub>} is the set of all the vectors that can be referred by a linear combination of these. For example, the vectors (0, 1) and (1, 0) can span the entire two dimensional space. But the vectors (1, 1) and (2, 2) can span only one line in the two dimensional space. Thus the span of the set {(1, 1) and (2, 2)} is just a line while the span of the set {(0, 1), (1, 0)} is a plane.</p><p>In formal terms,</p><pre><code class='python'>    span({x<sub>1</sub>, . . . x<sub>n</sub>}) = {v : v = &sum; &alpha;<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i</sub>, &alpha;<sub>i</sub> &isin; R<sup>n</sup>}</code></pre><p>If we have n vectors are linearly independent, their span is R<sup>n</sup>.</p><p>The projection of a vector y &isin; R<sup>m</sup>} onto the span of n linearly independent vectors {x<sub>1</sub>, . . . x<sub>n</sub>} &isin; R<sup>m</sup>} (here, m &gt; n), is the vector v &isin; span{x<sub>1</sub>, . . . x<sub>n</sub>} such that y is as close to v as possible.</p><p>Formally:</p><pre><code class='python'>    proj(y; {x<sub>1</sub>, . . . x<sub>n</sub>}) = argmin<sub> v &isin; span({x<sub>1</sub>, . . . x<sub>n</sub>})</sub>(||y - v||<sub>2</sub>) </code></pre><p>The Range R(A) also called the columnspace of a matrix is essentially the span of its columns. For a matrix A &isin; R<sup>m x n</sup>, the range is defined as</p><pre><code class='python'>    R(A) = {v &isin; R<sup>m</sup> : v = Ax , x &isin; R<sup>n</sup>}</code></pre><p>This gives us some interesting properties.</p><p>If A is full rank and m &gt; n, the projection works out to be</p><pre><code class='python'>    proj(y, A) = A(A<sup>T</sup>A)<sup>-1</sup>A<sup>T</sup>y</code></pre><p>Finally, the null space of a vector A &isin; R<sup>m x n</sup>, denoted by N(A), is the set of all the vectors that equal 0 when multiplied by A. That is:</p><pre><code class='python'>    N(A) = {x &isin; R<sup>n</sup>: Ax = 0}</code></pre><p>Interestingly, R(A<sup>T</sup>) and N(A) are disjoint sets and span the entire n dimensional space. Thus, any point in R<sup>n</sup> is either in R(A<sup>T</sup>) or N(A); and never in both.</p><p>Hence they are called orthogonal complements of each other.</p>
