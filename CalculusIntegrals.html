<p>Integrals are often called anti-derivatives. It can be considered a reverse of the derivative process. If f'(x) is the derivative of function f(x), then f(x) is the integral of f'(x) - indefinite integral.</p><pre><code class='python'>    g(x) = f'(x)    =&gt;    f(x) = &int;g(x)dx + c</code></pre><p>Note that we always add the constant c with the anti-derivative. That is to remind us that we had eliminated a constant when we obtained the derivative of the function. </p><p>(Remember that derivative of a constant is 0 - hence f(x) = g(x) + c =&gt; f'(x) = g'(x). We need to get that constant back when we get the anti-derivative.)</p><p>But that is a bad way of looking at integrals. Integrals have their own identity and are not just reverse of derivatives. Intuitively, integral can be considered to be the area covered under a given function curve.</p><p>To elaborate this further, suppose we have to calculate the area under a constant function f(x) = c. We just multiply x * c. That gives us the area of the rectangle under it.</p><p>But, if the function is not a simple straight line, we have to do more. We can pick up smaller rectangles under the curve. But we might end up missing the accuracy if we try to approximate the area to rectangles under the curve. But that loss is related to the width of the rectangles we take. Thinner the rectangles, lesser is the loss. And as the width of the rectangle tends to 0, the loss is 0 as well. Thus,</p><pre><code class='python'>    &int;f(x)dx = f(0).x + lim<sub> n &rarr; &infin; </sub>&sum; x.f(x.i/n)/n</code></pre><p>Thus, in a way, derivatives refer to difference and division while integral refers to sum and multiplication.</p><h3>Definite Integrals</h3><hr/><p>Indefinite integrals refer to generic functions. But definite integrals are defined between two end points.</p><div class='center'><img src='img/calculus01.png' /></div><p>Essentially, &int;f(x)dx is a function of x - say F(x). The difference between F(b) and F(a) is what defines the definite integral. Note that the result of the definite integral is not a function of x. There is no x in F(b) - F(a).</p><p>Here, a and b can take various different values. The common ones are (0, x), (0, 1), (0, infinity), (-infinity, infinity)</p><p>Thus, we have two fundamental theorems of calculus:</p><div class='center'><img src='img/calculus02.png' /></div>
