<p>The concept of matrix multiplication is not so intuitive. Suppose we have two matrices A &isin; R<sup>m x n</sup> and B &isin; R<sup>n x p</sup>, the product of the two matrices is C &isin; R<sup>m x p</sup> where</p><pre><code class='python'>    C<sub>ij</sub> = &sum; A<sub>ik</sub> B<sub>kj</sub></code></pre><p>Note the sizes of of the three matrices. For the product A x B to exist, the number of columns in the matrix A must be the same as the number of rows in matrix B. In this case, the product will have rows as many as A and columns as many as B</p><p>There could be 4 possibilities of matrix product. Matrix - Matrix product, Matrix - Vector product, Vector - Matrix product and Vector - Vector product. Let us look at two special cases here:</p><h3>Vector - Vector Product</h3><hr/><div class='center'><img src='img/linalg02.png' /></div><p>Given two vectors x, y &isin; R<sup>n</sup>, x<sup>T</sup>y - the dot product of the two vectors - is a real number.</p><h3>Matrix-Vector Product</h3><hr/><div class='center'><img src='img/linalg03.png' /></div><p>Given a matrix A &isin; R<sup>m x n</sup> and a vector x &isin; R<sup>n</sup>. Their product y = Ax is a vector &isin; R<sup>m</sup>. In other words, y is a linear combination of the columns of A, where the coefficients of the linear combination are given by the entries of x.</p><p>It is interesting to note here that matrix multiplication</p><ul><li>Is not commutative. A x B may not be equal to B x A. In fact B x A may not even exist.</li><li>But it is distributive. A x (B + C) = A x B + A x B</li><li>And it is also associative. A x (B x C) = (A x B) x C</li></ul><h3>Identity Matrix</h3><hr/><p>By definition, multiplicative identity is a matrix I such that A x I = A. Here, I happens to be a matrix where all the diagonal elements are 1 and others are 0. In more formal terms, for a matrix A &isin; R<sup>m x n</sup>, the identity matrix is the matrix I &isin; R<sup>n x n</sup> such that I<sub>ij</sub> = 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise.</p><p>In general the size of an identity matrix is not important. Just that it should be a square matrix (with equal number of rows and columns) such that I<sub>ij</sub> = 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise.</p>
