<p>Error analysis is the analysis of error. He he! You don't have to tell me that. In fact, the whole theory of error analysis is as intuitive. But, people tend to miss some points in real projects. We can treat this as a kind of refresher that one can check out - when trouble makes us forget the basics.</p><p>Formally, error Analysis refers to the process of examining dev set examples that your algorithm misclassified, so that we can understand the underlying causes of the errors. This can help us prioritize on which problem deserves attention and how much. It gives us a direction for handling the errors.</p><p>Error analysis is not just a final salvaging operation. It can be a part of the mainstream development. When we start building a model, we are advised to start off with a small model - that is bound to have low accuracy (high error). We can then start evaluating this model and analyze the errors. As we analyze the errors, we can then grow with the model.</p>
