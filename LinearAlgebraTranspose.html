<p>The transpose of a matrix obtained by flipping it around the diagonal. In formal terms, for a matrix A &isin; R<sup>m x n</sup>, the transpose A<sup>T</sup> is matrix B &isin; R<sup>n x m</sup> such that B<sub>ij</sub> = A<sub>ji</sub></p><p>Interesting properties of transpose operation</p><ul><li>(A<sup>T</sup>)<sup>T</sup> = A</li><li>(A x B)<sup>T</sup> = B<sup>T</sup> x A<sup>T</sup></li><li>(A + B)<sup>T</sup> = A<sup>T</sup> + B<sup>T</sup></li></ul><h3>Symmetric Matrix</h3><hr/><p>A symmetric matrix that is symmetric along the diagonal. In formal terms, matrix A &isin; R<sup>n x n</sup> is symmetric if A<sup>T</sup> = A. And matrix A &isin; R<sup>n x n</sup> is anti-symmetric if A<sup>T</sup> = -A</p><p>Note that the matrix has to be a square matrix in order to be a symmetric or anti-symmetric.</p><p>Observe that for any matrix A, A + A<sup>T</sup>  is symmetric and A - A<sup>T</sup> is anti-symmetric. Thus, any matrix A = ((A + A<sup>T</sup>) + (A - A<sup>T</sup>))/2. That means, any matrix A can be expressed as a sum of a symmetric matrix and an anti-symmetric matrix. </p><p>This property is important for subsequent derivations. Symmetric matrices have very nice properties that are useful in real life calculations. It is common to denote a symmetric matrix using S. Thus, A &isin; S<sup>n</sup> means that A is an n x n dimensional symmetric matrix.</p>
