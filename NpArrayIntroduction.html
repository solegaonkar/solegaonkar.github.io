<p>The numpy array (ndarray) is the basic building block of all numpy computations. The ndarray provides a lot of features for computation. It provides for a multidimensional array. It is a table of elements. It could be any data type. But numpy requires that all the elements have the same data type. In most applications, we use arrays of numbers, and occasionally binary.</p><p>It does not throw an error if you do provide different types. NumPy just forces them all into one type. They why not just let it do the job? It's a good practice not to mess around with these implementation specific details. Hence it is always a good idea to ensure consistency in the data types.</p><p>Since these arrays are multidimensional, they are indexed using a tuple of positive integers - each for one dimension. In NumPy, these dimensions are called axes.</p><h2>Fields</h2><hr/><p>The implementation of ndarray is quite different from the standard Python Array. Before we dive into the functionality, let us look into the fields inside the ndarray.</p><p>For this, let us create a dummy numpy array. The section below deals with various different ways of creating a numpy array. For now, let us just use one of them to get a simple two dimensional array.</p><pre><code class='python'>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]])</code></pre><h4>ndarray.ndim</h4><p>The number of axes (dimensions) of the array.</p><pre><code class='python'>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.ndim
2</code></pre><h4>ndarray.shape</h4><p>The actual dimensions of the array. This is a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with n rows and m columns, shape will be (n,m). The length of the shape tuple is therefore the number of axes, ndim.</p><pre><code class='python'>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.shape
(3, 5)</code></pre><h4>ndarray.size</h4><p>The total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape.</p><pre><code class='python'>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.size
15</code></pre><h4>ndarray.dtype</h4><p>This is an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can create or specify dtype's using standard Python types. Additionally NumPy provides types of its own. numpy.int32, numpy.int16, and numpy.float64 are some examples.</p><pre><code class='python'>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.dtype.name
'int64'</code></pre><h4>ndarray.itemsize</h4><p>The size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type float64 has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to ndarray.dtype.itemsize.</p><pre><code class='python'>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.itemsize
8</code></pre><h4>ndarray.data</h4><p>the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally, we wonâ€™t need to use this attribute because we will access the elements in an array using indexing facilities.</p>
