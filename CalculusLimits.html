<p>This is the fundamental concept that forms basis for all of Calculus. What exactly does it mean? In simple words, Limits deal with the concept of value that are not equal but "almost" equal to the subject. A simple example quoted to demonstrate this concept is this:</p><p>For a real variable x, What is the value of x/x? We may be tempted to say 1. But that is not so. x/x is 1 for all values of x except 0. Its value is not defined at 0, because 0/0 is not defined. But for any other number, it is defined and the value is 1. It is 1 for x = 1 or 0.1 or 0.00001 or 0.00000000001 ... For any number however small. Thus, for any number that is "almost" zero, its value is 1. Thus, although it is not defined at 0,</p><pre><code class='python'>    lim<sub> x &rarr; 0 </sub>x/x = 1</code></pre><p>That is, "limit as x tends to 0 of x/x is 1"</p><h3>Negative & Positive Limits</h3><hr/><p>The example above was pretty straightforward. But life is not so simple! We often deal with functions that are not continuous. Consider for example, a complicated function that describes tossing of a coin - maps the details of the throw to the outcome head or tail.  This cannot be a continuous function. It should have a step. How do we calculate limits in such a case?</p><p>Here, we cannot get the limit. But, It may be possible to get the left and right limits independently. In general, if the left and right limits match, the function is continuous at that point.</p><pre><code class='python'>    lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>f(x) = M if and only if lim<sub> x &rarr; a- </sub>f(x) = lim<sub> x &rarr; a+ </sub>f(x) = M</code></pre><p>In general, it is possible that we the limit for a function at a given value may not be defined.</p><h3>Infinity</h3><hr/><p>This is an interesting concept that emerged out of the theory of limits. Division by 0 is not defined in algebra. But what does the theory of limits say about it? What is the limit of 1/x as x tends to 0? We can easily see that the value of 1/x increases as x reduces. For any 1/x, we have 2/x that is even larger. Moreover, the closer to zero we get, the value of 1/x increases faster and faster. Thus, as we go to 'almost zero', the value of 1/x is larger than any number known. That is defined as infinity. In formal terms,</p><pre><code class='python'>    lim<sub> x &rarr; 0 </sub>1/x = &infin;</code></pre><p>Now how about the lower and upper limits? Are they equal? As per the definition of infinity, they are. Thus, the number line is twisted around to create a number circle, so that negative infinity is equal to positive infinity.</p><p>So what is the big deal about just defining a crazy new number? Does it have any meaning anywhere? Yes, it has a lot of meaning in calculus itself. As we go deeper, we will come across several theorems that depend upon this infinity. We will often see the applications of the term limit as n tends to infinity.</p><h3>Important Properties</h3><hr/><p>Some important theorems related to Limits are useful when working with calculus. For a in the input space of functions f(x), g(x), constant k and natural number n:</p><ul><li>Suppose that f and g are functions such that f(x) = g(x) for all x in some open interval interval containing a except possibly for a, then</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>f(x) = lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>g(x)</code></pre><ul><li>The limit of a constant function is the constant itself.</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>k = k</code></pre><ul><li>Constant multiplied by the limit of a function is the limit of constant multiplied by the function</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>k . f(x) = k . lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>f(x)</code></pre><ul><li>The limit of sum is sum of the limits</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>(f(x) + g(x)) = lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>f(x) + lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>g(x)</code></pre><ul><li>The limit of difference is the difference of the limits</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>(f(x) - g(x)) = lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>f(x) - lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>g(x)</code></pre><ul><li>The limit of a product is the product of limits</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>(f(x) . g(x)) = lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>f(x) . lim<sub> x &rarr; a </sub>g(x)</code></pre><ul><li>The limit of ratio is the ratio of limits.
