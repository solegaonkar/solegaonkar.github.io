<p>Like any Python module, TensorFlow is an external library that needs to be imported into the script before we can use it. </p><pre><code class='python'>import tensorflow as tf</code></pre><p>Along with TensorFlow, we typically import a few other libraries that make our life simpler. Keras is a part of TensorFlow. It helps us develop high order models very easily. We can create the models using TensorFlow alone. However, Keras simplifies our job.</p><pre><code class='python'>from tensorflow import keras</code></pre><p>NumPy is a default import in any machine learning task. We cannot life without it. Almost all data manipulations require NumPy.</p><pre><code class='python'>import numpy as np</code></pre><p>Another important module is the matplotlib. It is very important that we visualize the available data, to get a feel of what hides in it. Any amount of algorithmic analysis can not give us what we get by just looking at the data in a graphical form.</p><pre><code class='python'>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</code></pre><p>TensorFlow has gone through a lot of changes over the versions. The concepts did not change much, but some of the methods have. It is a good practice to check the version we use. If we have a problem, we can check the help for the specific version. Many developers have faced the problem due to version conflict so it is a lot simpler to search forums for problems in specific versions.</p><pre><code class='python'>print(tf.__version__)

1.12.0</code></pre><p>All my code is based on version 1.12.0</p>
