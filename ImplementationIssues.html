<p>Theory and implementation are often just poles apart. It is important to understand the theory. But it is even more important to understand how to put it into practice. For that, we need an idea about the kind of issues involved in solving real world problems and the typical solutions employed.</p>
<h3>Best Practices</h3><hr/><p>It is wise not to waste time in solving all problems right from the first principles. There are times when we must question these basics and try to think differently, but often it is wiser to start with these established best practices and see how things work.</p><p>Machine Learning experts have defined several such best practices. A lot of them may seem intuitive and trivial. Others seem to be nerdy. But, as we said, it is important to have these in mind when we start. That helps us focus on the real problem rather than the peripherals.</p>

<h3>Enhance the Data</h3><hr/><p>The AI model that we build can be only as good as the data we feed it. Hence, data preparation is a major step in the entire life cycle. It starts with identifying a good data source, collecting and storing the data and then polishing the data in a way that can help us use it.</p>

<h3>Error Analysis</h3><hr/><p>Things are easier said than done. A  neural network model cannot be developed by merely passing a model through several iterations of training. A lot more is required. Error analysis is one of the major steps in here.</p>
