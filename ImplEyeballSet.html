<p>Now we know that our model has errors and there could be several sources of errors. But, how do we identify which one? We have millions of records in the training set, and atleast thousands of records in the dev set. The test set is not in sight as yet!</p><p>We cannot evaluate every record in the training set. Nor can we evaluate each record in the dev set. In order to identify the kind of errors our model generates, we split the dev set into two parts - the eyeball set and the blackbox set. The eyeball set is the sample set that we actually evaluate. We can check these records manually, to guess the source of errors. So the eyeball set should be small enough that we can work manually and large enough to get a statistical representation of the whole dev set.</p><p>On analyzing the errors in the eyeball set, we can identify the different error sources and the contribution of each. With this information, we can start working on the major error sources. As we make appropriate fixes, we can go on digging for more error sources.</p><p>Note that the analysis should be based on the eyeball set only. If we use the entire dev set for this analysis, we will end up overfitting the dev set. But if the dev set is not big enough, we have to use the whole of it. Just note in that case that we have a good risk of overfitting the dev set - and plan the rest accordingly.</p>
