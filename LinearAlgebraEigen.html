<p>Given a square matrix A &isin; R<sup>n x n</sup>, we say that &lambda; &isin; C is the eigenvalue and x &isin; R<sup>n</sup> is the corresponding eigenvector if Ax = &lambda;x for x &ne; 0. Note that &lambda; and x need not be real. They could be complex.</p><p>Intuitively, if we multiply a matrix by the eigenvector, the result points in the same direction as x, but scaled by a factor &lambda;. </p><p>Note that for any scalar c, if x is an eigenvector, cx is also an eigenvector. Thus, when we refer to the eigenvector for the eigenvalue &lambda, we imply the one that is normalized to 1. This too involves the confusion between x and -x. But that is not a major problem.</p><p>We can rewrite the above equation as</p><pre><code class='python'>    (&lambda;I - A)x = 0</code></pre><p>Interestingly, this means that (&lambda;I - A) has a non empty null space - implying that it is a singular matrix - implying that its determinant is 0. Thus, we have </p><pre><code class='python'>    |(&lambda;I - A)| = 0.</code></pre><p>We can use the definition of determinant to solve this n<sup>th</sup> order polynomial equation and get n complex values of &lambda; and then we can solve further to find the individual eigenvectors.</p><p>Of course solving an n<sup>th</sup> order polynomial is not a joke - for high values of n. There are better ways of solving this problem. But  this was the simplest way that can sufficiently elaborate the concept. Some interesting properties for A &isin; R<sup>n x n</sup></p><ul><li>The trace of A is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues</li><li>The determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.</li><li>The rank of A is equal to the number of non-zero eigenvalues.</li><li>If A is invertible, (1/&lambda;<sub>i</sub>) is the eigenvalue of A<sup>-1</sup></li><li>The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are the individual diagonal elements.</li></ul><p>We can write the entire eigenvector equation as</p><pre><code class='python'>    AX = X&Lambda;</code></pre><p>Where columns of X are the eigenvectors and &Lambda; is the diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements are the corresponding eigenvalues. If the eigenvectors of A are linearly independent then X is invertible. In that case, we can rewrite the above equation as</p><pre><code class='python'>    A = X&Lambda;X<sup>-1</sup></code></pre><p>A matrix  that can be written in this form is called diagonalizable.</p>
