<p>The Oracle database is rightly named so. You need to be an oracle to understand it and guess what is hidden inside it; or what it is doing in the background; or to make it do what you want it to do.</p><p>Well not so bad, they have provided us great tools that can help us monitor and motivate it to do good work. Being a mature application, these problems as well as their solutions are now well known and well documented. But it takes effort to learn and understand each of them accurately. These blogs contain details of what I learnt while playing with the database.</p><h2>Basics</h2><hr/><p>No! I am not going to talk about the standard CRUD operations. Certainly don't want to waste disk space and bandwidth on something like that. The blogs here talk about some common best practices and ways of working with the database.</p><h2>Peeping In</h2><hr/><p>There are times when we need to know what the database is doing behind the scene. We need to know how the queries do inside the database. Oracle provides us a good amount of utilities for doing this.</p><ul><li><a href="oracleCurrentQuery.html" class='link'>Currently running queries</a></li></ul>
