<p>Algorithmia provides a cloud based implementations of the major AI algorithms. They provide easy API calls that can do most of the normal AI tasks - charged per REST API call. </p><p>We can also implement and deploy our own models into REST API's. This can be done in many different languages including Java, Python, Rust, Ruby, R, JavaScript and Scala. These can be invoked using the simple REST API calls. </p><p>Algorithmia integrates well with many different platforms. It can be invoked through an AWS Lambda, or triggered on a Telegram Bot. It can fetch data from social media like Twitter or data hosts like Google Sheets. We can also deploy H2O models directly into Algorithmia.</p><p>Algorithmia also provides thousands of models for many common AI problems. These too can be used by invoking a simple REST API. These include various image processing applications like colorization of a monochrome image, nudity detection; NLP applications like sentiment analysis, and many more.</p><p>We can create a free account with an initial trial credit. Model deployment and API calls beyond the free tier will be charged.</p>
