<p>There are several books and tutorials on Python. But, in terms of completeness and clarity, I have not come across anything better than the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial">Python Tutorial</a> provided by the Python community</p><h3>Installing Python</h3><hr/><p>There are many different sources and distributions of Python. Foremost is available on their own site <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">Install Python</a>. This page has everything you need. Download the version you like. We also have other distributions like <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a> that package a good amount of useful stuff along with the base Python. This is what most enthusiasts use. And then there are other commercial distributions of Python like ActiveState Python that charge you for support and packaging. That is meant for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1352528/why-does-activepython-exist">people who prefer to spend money</a>.</p><p>Python comes with its own editor (IDLE) that provides syntax highlighting. It is good for developing and running minor scripts and also for testing single commands. But, for doing anything more complex and useful, you will need a better IDE. Several open source IDE's are available on the net. The list keeps growing. Just lookup one you like from Google and you should be ready to go. I liked Pycharm, Spider and Atom. If you don't like these, just search for one on the net and let me know if you find something useful.</p><h3>Traditions</h3><hr/><p>We often put in a lot of effort on Traditions. We do a lot of things we don't really know why, but we do them because "that is the way"! The "Hello World" is another such tradition. None knows what is so magical about those two words. But there is something so magical that everyone wants to use just that phrase. </p><p>Anyway, let's do the same here - announcing to the world that we have started learning Python.Open your IDE and create a new Project - Learn Python or HelloWorld; Create a new file with the appropriate extension (.py).</p><p>If you are running on Windows, the extension should be enough. But if you are fond of Linux, the extension has no meaning. You need to explicitly indicate the interpreter using the shabang on the first line of the script. After that, add the following one line in the new script.</p><pre><code class='python'>#!/bin/python
print("Hello World")</code></pre><p>(The shabang would point to python or python3 depending upon the Python distribution that you use.)</p><p>That is all we need in order to start. The code prints the two words - Hello World - Nothing much for the world, but it does tell you that you have started well!</p>
