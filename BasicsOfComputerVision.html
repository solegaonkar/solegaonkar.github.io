<p>With the latest developments in Big data, we are not short of the data or infrastructure we need to train an AI model. Now, algorithmic developments are pushing the testing errors of intelligent systems to converge to Bayes optimal error. With these developments, computer vision has taken a great momentum.</p><p>Computer vision deals with algorithms and applications of concepts of Machine Learning to processing images.</p><p>Here is an overview of some important algorithmic concepts in computer vision</p><ul><li><a href="ConceptImageProcessing.html" class='link'>What is Image?</a></li><li><a href="CvIntroduction.html" class='link'>Introduction to Computer Vision</a></li><li><a href="CvEdgeDetection.html" class='link'>Edge Detection</a></li><li><a href='CvConvolutionalNerualNetworks.html' class='link'>Convolutional Neural Networks</a></li></ul>
