<p>Pytorch can be considered as an enhanced NumPy, that uses the power of GPU's. It is also packed with different modules that make it a good platform for deep learning research.</p><p>Pytorch works with Tensors - that are similar to the ndarrays in NumPy. But, Tensors use the power of GPU's.</p><p>For working with PyTorch, we need to start with importing the pytorch module.</p><pre><code class='python'>import torch</code></pre>
