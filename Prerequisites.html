<p>Before we start looking into the details, it is important to revise and brush up some basics. To understand Machine learning, we need to understand some basic concepts 
of mathematics. Of all the different domains in Mathematics, the three - Linear Algebra, Statistics and Calculus are absolutely necessary. 
Here is a brief refresher of these domains. Certainly not a reference, but it should help us remember what we had learnt in school</p>

<p>Domain knowledge is very important for understanding artificial intelligence. Before we teach the machines, it is necessary that we understand at 
least the basics of  the domain. AI is spreading across almost all aspects of our life. Yet, there are some domains where the application of AI has 
already created wonders. It is important to understand them before we move forward with real applications.</p>
