<p>Given a square matrix A &isin; R<sup>n x n</sup> and a vector x &isin; R<sup>n</sup>, the scalar value obtained by x<sup>T</sup>Ax is defined as the quadratic form. Note that:</p><pre><code class='python'>    x<sup>T</sup>Ax = &sum; x<sub>i</sub>(Ax)<sub>i</sub> = &sum; x<sub>i</sub> &sum; A<sub>ij</sub>x<sub>j</sub> = &sum;<sub>i</sub> &sum;<sub>j</sub> A<sub>ij</sub>x<sub>i</sub>x<sub>j</sub></code></pre><p>Also, since the value is a scalar,</p><pre><code class='python'>    x<sup>T</sup>Ax = (x<sup>T</sup>Ax)<sup>T</sup> = x<sup>T</sup>A<sup>T</sup>x = x<sup>T</sup>(A + A<sup>T</sup>)x/2</code></pre><p>From this, we can conclude that only the symmetric part of A contributes to the quadratic form. Hence, we implicitly assume that matrices appearing in the quadratic form are symmetric.</p><p>Based on this, for a non zero vector x &isin; R<sup>n</sup>, a symmetric matrix A &isin; S<sup>n</sup> is</p><ul><li>Positive Definite (PD) - If x<sup>T</sup>Ax &gt; 0 - Denoted by A &gt; 0</li><li>Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) - If x<sup>T</sup>Ax &gt;= 0 - Denoted by A &gt;= 0</li><li>Negative Definite (ND) - If x<sup>T</sup>Ax &lt; 0 - Denoted by A &lt; 0</li><li>Negative Semi-Definite (NSD) - If x<sup>T</sup>Ax &lt;= 0 - Denoted by A &gt; 0</li><li>Indefinite if none of the above - There exist x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> such that x<sub>1</sub><sup>T</sup>Ax<sub>1</sub> &gt; 0 and x<sub>2</sub><sup>T</sup>Ax<sub>2</sub> &lt; 0.</li></ul><p>Obviously, if A is positive definite, -A is negative definite; and so on. An important property of positive definite and negative definite matrices is that they are always full rank and invertible.</p><p>Gram Matrix presents an interesting case. It is defined as a matrix  that can be expressed as G = A<sup>T</sup>A - for any A &isin; R<sup>m x n</sup>. Note that A could be any matrix, need not be square. Any Gram Matrix G is always Positive Semi-Definite. Further, if m &gt;= n and A is full rank, G = A<sup>T</sup>A  is Positive Definite.</p>
