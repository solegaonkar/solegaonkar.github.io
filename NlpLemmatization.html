<p>Lemmatisation is the process of reducing a group of words into their lemma or dictionary form. It takes into account things like POS(Parts of Speech), the meaning of the word in the sentence, the meaning of the word in the nearby sentences etc. before reducing the word to its lemma.</p><p>This is an important pre-processing step in many NLP applications (e.g. morphological analyzers, electronic dictionaries, spell-checkers, stemmers, etc.). It is also useful in identifying keywords for search engines and other data mining, clustering and classification tools.</p><h2>Approaches</h2><hr/><p>Researchers have identified several approaches for doing this. Each has its advantages in terms of resources, processing, and error level. One must choose the appropriate path depending upon the requirements of the problem at hand.</p><h3>Levenshtein Distance Dictionary</h3><hr/><p>The Levenshtein Distance or the edit distance of two strings A and B is the minimum number of character transformation required to convert string A to string B.  That includes the three most "primitive edit operation" - insert, delete and substitute. </p><p>An important point to understand about lemmatization is this - the word "going" is mapped to "go". But "went" is a different lemma in the dictionary - it is not mapped to go. That is logical, and in fact, that is a lot easier to implement that way.</p>
