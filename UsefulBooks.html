<p>Tutorials and blogs are great for an introduction to the subject and to keep in touch with the latest developments. But if you want to go deeper and master it inside-out, you have no alternative to books. Here are some of the useful text books and cookbooks that can help you master the subject.</p><h3>Text Books</h3><hr/><p>Textbooks are required to give a thorough introduction to a subject, elaborating on all the fundamental concepts. Here are some that I found very useful.</p><ul><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2MnOCPr'>Machine Learning</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2N7Ku2j'>Deep Learning</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2vYPAaQ'>Core Python</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2PoSxcP'>An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2Pspllk'>Practical Convolutional Neural Networks</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2vYKbR6Z'>Hands-On Reinforcement Learning with Python</a></li></ul><h3>Cook Books</h3><hr/><p>Text Books give us a good understanding of the subject. But, often it helps to get some ready solutions to common problems. That helps us from re-inventing the wheel. The cookbooks help us with that. Here are some that can help us in that.</p><ul><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2PnCSdA'>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensor Flow</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2PspJjM'>Deep Learning with Keras</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2PqZfyN'>TensorFlow 1.x Deep Learning Cookbook</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2w1ZEjb'>R for Data Science</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2MB0nl7'>Neural Networks with R</a></li></ul><h3>Light Read</h3><hr/><p>Some of the great authors have contributed to the literature. These may not directly help you understand the technical aspects of the subject. But they will surely help broaden your perspective.</p><ul><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2PnWGO6'>The Master Algorithm</a></li><li><a href='https://amzn.to/2MDluTF'>Deep Thinking</a></li></ul>
