<p>As the name suggests, this is all about differences. How does the function change? What is the direction of change? Does it increase or decrease with the input parameter? Or is it constant? </p><p>Change cannot be limited to a point. By definition we need a duration to define this "change". But, what if we want to know how it is doing at the given point? The derivative of the function helps us with this. </p><p>Essentially, the derivative of a function is the limit of change in the function over the duration that tends to 0.</p><pre><code class='python'>    f'(x) = lim<sub> h &rarr; 0 </sub>(f(x+h) - f(x-h)) / 2h</code></pre><p>For this to exist, the function must be continuous at that point. Intuitively, we can imagine the derivative as the slope of the tangent at that point.</p><h3>Derivative rules</h3><hr/><p>For functions f, g, h and constant b;<ul><li>Derivative of the constant function is 0</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    f(x) = b    =&gt;    f'(x) = 0</code></pre><ul><li>Derivative of identity function is 1</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    f(x) = x    =&gt;    f'(x) = 1</code></pre><ul><li>Derivative of constant multiple of a function is the multiple of the derivative</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    g(x) = k.f(x)    =&gt;    g'(x) = k.f'(x)</code></pre><ul><li>Derivative of n<sup>th</sup> power of x is n times (n-1)<sup>th</sup> power of x</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    f(x) = x<sup>n</sup>    =&gt;    f'(x) = n.x<sup>n-1</sup></code></pre><ul><li>The derivative of an exponential function is the value of the function multiplied by the derivative at 0</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    f(x) = b<sup>x</sup>    =&gt;    f'(x) = b<sup>x</sup>.f'(0)
    f(x) = e<sup>x</sup>    =&gt;    f'(x) = e<sup>x</sup></code></pre><ul><li>Sum of derivatives is derivative of the sum</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    (f + g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)</code></pre><ul><li>Derivative of product of functions.</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    (fg)'(x) = f(x).g'(x) + g(x).f'(x)</code></pre><ul><li>Derivative of quotient of functions</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    (f/g)'(x) = (f'(x).g(x) - f(x).g'(x)) / (g(x))<sup>2</sup></code></pre><ul><li>Chain Rule</li></ul><pre><code class='python'>    f(x) = g '(h(x))    =&gt;    f'(x) = g'(h(x)).h'(x)</code></pre><h3>Higher Order Derivatives</h3><hr/><p>As we saw above, the derivative of a function is essentially yet another function of x. This function can have a derivative as well - giving us another function. This gives us higher order derivatives. The derivative of the derivative is called the second order derivative - f''(x). Its derivative is called the third order derivative... leading us to the n<sup>th</sup> order derivative f<sup>n</sup>(x)</p><p>The derivative of a function is an indicator of how the function is moving. If it is positive, the function is increasing. But it has little to say about how much it will increase? Will it continue to increase? Faster or slower? Will it decrease after some time? All these questions can be important when analyzing the output. </p><p>To answer these questions, we look at the higher order derivatives. In fact, we can get the value of a function just looking at its derivatives.</p><pre><code class='python'>    f(x) =  f(0) + x.f'(0) + x<sup>2</sup>.f''(0) / 2! + ... + x<sup>n</sup>.fn(x) / n! + ... &infin;</code></pre><p>Remember that n! (n factorial) is the product of all natural numbers up to n. We can prove this recursively. A special case is f(x) = e<sup>x</sup> - where all derivatives are 1.</p><h3>Critical Point</h3><hr/><p>A point where the derivative is 0 is called a critical point. Here, we have 4 possibilities.</p><ul><li>Constant function</li><li>Local Minimum</li><li>Local Maximum</li><li>Inflection</li></ul><p>A constant function always has a derivative of 0. So there is nothing special about this particular point. Hence we ignore that case. </p><p>But, if it is not a constant function, we can have two scenarios - Either it is taking a U turn or is a simple inflection. If it is a U turn, it could be a local minimum or maximum. Now how do we identify this? We can check it out by looking at the second order derivative. </p><p>If the second order derivative is positive, then it means that the first derivative is increasing. If it is 0 at this point, it means it was negative before this - implying that the function was decreasing. Now that the first derivative has crossed 0, it will be positive - implying that the function will start increasing. Thus, we have are on a local minimum. Local because it need not be the absolute minimum. We can have other minimum that is lower than this.</p><p>Similarly, for a negative second order derivative, we can conclude that it was a local maximum. But what if the second order derivative is also 0? That means it was not a minimum or a maximum. It was just a small  inflection.</p><h3>Multivariate Differentiation</h3><hr/><p>So far we have seen functions that have only one input parameter. In real life, we rarely have an outcome that depends upon a single input. Most real life functions take multiple input variables. How do we work on derivatives of such functions? To visualize this, we need to imagine an n+1 dimensional space where n is the number of input parameters. The function is defined by a plane in this n+1 dimensional space - defined by the value of the function at each possible value of the input.</p><p>Here, the the output value potentially changes with any change in any of the input variables. This defines the derivative with respect to that particular input variable. In such a scenario, we consider the partial derivatives. That is the derivative of the function with respect to one variable, while the others are constant.</p><p>A simple example:</p><pre><code class='python'>    f(x, y) = x<sup>2</sup> + xy + 3y<sup>3</sup></code></pre><p>Here, we can calculae the partial derivative with respect to x, and partial y at x,y:</p><pre><code class='python'>    f'<sub>x</sub>(x, y) = 2x + y
    f'<sub>y</sub>(x, y) = x + 9y<sup>2</sup></code></pre>
