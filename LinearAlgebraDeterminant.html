<p>The determinant of a matrix |A| or det(A) can be considered as the "volume" of space covered by its rows - the volume of the hyper cube defined by points that are a linear combination of the row vectors (a<sub>i</sub>), such that the linear coefficients are less than or equal to 1. That is, the volume covered by the set S such that</p><pre><code class='python'>    S = {v &isin; R<sup>n</sup> : v = &sum; &alpha;<sub>i</sub>a<sub>i</sub> where 0 &lt;= &alpha;<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 1}</code></pre><p>The absolute value of the determinant is the volume covered by this set S.</p><p>Algebraically; for A &isin; R<sup>n x n</sup> consider A<sub>\i\j</sub> &isin; R<sup>(n-1) x (n-1)</sup> be the matrix generated by discarding the i<sup>th</sup> row and j<sup>th</sup> column. Then, the general recursive formula for the determinant is:</p><pre><code class='python'>    |A| = &sum;<sub>i</sub> (-1)<sup>(i+j)</sup> a<sub>ij</sub>|A<sub>\i\j</sub>| for any j in 1 .. n
        = &sum;<sub>j</sub> (-1)<sup>(i+j)</sup> a<sub>ij</sub>|A<sub>\i\j</sub>| for any i in 1 .. n</code></pre><p>The determinant is ugly to calculate. But people have developed efficient libraries that help us with this. It is important to understand the concept, and leave the algebra to the machines.</p><p>Intuitively, we can think of the determinant as the difference between the two sets of extended diagonals products. For a  3x3 matrix, the determinant can be calculated as</p>
<pre><code class='python'>    |A| = a<sub>11</sub>a<sub>22</sub>a<sub>33</sub> + a<sub>12</sub>a<sub>23</sub>a<sub>31</sub> + a<sub>13</sub>a<sub>21</sub>a<sub>32</sub> - a<sub>11</sub>a<sub>23</sub>a<sub>32</sub>  - a<sub>12</sub>a<sub>21</sub>a<sub>33</sub> - a<sub>13</sub>a<sub>23</sub>a<sub>31</sub></code></pre><p>The same is extended for higher order matrices.</p>
