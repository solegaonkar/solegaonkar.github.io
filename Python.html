<p>Innumerable technologies and programing languages are available for developers to learn and master. A life time may not suffice to learn them all! But, Techies still have the inner urge to learn and master newer and newer technologies - for the fun.</p>
<p>Python is one such language that is easy to learn and fun to code. Python has inherited the best of the practices from its counterparts, and has corrected a lot of issues they contain. Python is fun, Python is easy and Python is rich! It is backed by a huge open source community that ensures extensive support. It is ideal for rapid prototyping and fast development.</p>
