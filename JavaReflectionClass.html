<p><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html'>Class</a>  is the entry point for all reflection operations is java.lang.Class. There are several ways to get a Class depending on whether the code has access to an object, the name of class, a type, or an existing Class.</p><p>To get the class of an object - the class that is instantiated by the given object, you can use the method getClass()</p><pre><code class='java'>Class c = object.getClass();</code></pre><p>For any given class that is defined in the code, you can get the class object by accessing the field class. For example:</p><pre><code class='java'>Class c = java.util.Date.class</code></pre><p>If you have the name of the class in a String, you can get the corresponding Class object by using Class.forName() method. For example</p><pre><code class='java'>String s = "java.util.Date";
Class c = Class.forName(s);</code></pre><p>The class Class is quite rich and provides several useful methods for working with the Class objects.</p><h2>Important Methods</h2><hr/><p>Some of the common methods are listed here.</p><table><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>getSuperclass()</td><td>Returns the super class for the given class.</td></tr><tr><td>getClasses()</td><td>Returns all the public classes, interfaces, and enums that are members of the class including inherited members.</td></tr><tr><td>getDeclaredClasses()</td><td>Returns all of the classes interfaces, and enums that are explicitly declared in this class.</td></tr><tr><td>getDeclaringClass()</td><td>Returns the Class in which the class was declared.
