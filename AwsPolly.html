We can use it to make applications more engaging and accessible. It supports multiple languages and includes a variety of lifelike voices.</p><p>AWS takes care of most of the job here. For a developer, it is just a few lines of code:</p><pre><code class='python'>import boto3

polly_client = boto3.Session(
                aws_access_key_id=,                     
    aws_secret_access_key=,
    region_name='us-west-2').client('polly')

# Aditi specializes in Indian English.
response = polly_client.synthesize_speech(VoiceId='Aditi',
                OutputFormat='mp3', 
                Text = 'Provide the text here. Polly will speak it for you.')

file = open('speech.mp3', 'w')
file.write(response['AudioStream'].read())
file.close()</code></pre></body><script>loadPageFormat();</script></html>
