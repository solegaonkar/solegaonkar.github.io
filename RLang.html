<p>R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies of scholarly literature databases show that R's popularity has increased substantially in recent years. As of May 2018, R ranks 11th in the TIOBE index that measure of popularity of programming languages.</p><p>R is a GNU package. The source code for the R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself. R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems. While R has a command line interface, there are several graphical front-ends and integrated development environments available.</p><p>The following blogs give information about R gathered from various sources</p><ul><li><a href='RIntroduction.html' class='link'>Introduction</a><li><a href='RDataTypes.html' class='link'>Data Types</a><li><a href='ROperators.html' class='link'>Operators</a><li><a href='RCodeFlow.html' class='link'>Code Flow</a><li><a href='RMatrices.html' class='link'>Matrices</a><li><a href='RBuiltinDatasets.html' class='link'>Built-In Data Sets</a><li><a href='RDataFrames.html' class='link'>Data Frames</a><li><a href='RAnalyzingDataframe.html' class='link'>Analyzing Data Frames</a><li><a href='RIndexDataframe.html' class='link'>Indexing Data Frames</a><li><a href='RLists.html' class='link'>Lists</a><li><a href='RFileIo.html' class='link'>File IO</a></ul><p>R was developed for statistics and data analysis (unlike Python which is a generic multipurpose language), hence it is considered to be a lot more appropriate for handling data. Python v/s R is, after all, a personal and situational choice. But it is good to be proficient in either.</p><p>Just like Python, R has a huge open source support and a good chunk of supporting libraries.</p>
