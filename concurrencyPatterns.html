<p>This was once a dreaded paradigm, that only the experts used with extreme caution. Today, concurrency is an integral part of most applications. Naturally, everyone cannot (and should not) reinvent the wheel for implementing a concurrent system. Over the years, some common design patterns have emerged and these are borrowed by most designers. Here are some of the important concurrency patterns.</p><ul><li><a href="activeObjectPattern.html" class='link'>Active Object</a> - Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests.</li><li><a href="balkingPattern.html" class='link'>Balking</a> - Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.</li><li><a href="bindingPropertiesPattern.html" class='link'>Binding properties</a> - Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way.</li><li><a href="blockchainPattern.html" class='link'>Blockchain</a> - Decentralized way to store data and agree on ways of processing it in a Merkle tree, optionally using digital signature for any individual contributions.</li><li><a href="computeKernelPattern.html" class='link'>Compute kernel</a> - The same calculation many times in parallel, differing by integer parameters used with non-branching pointer math into shared arrays, such as GPU-optimized Matrix multiplication or Convolutional neural network.</li><li><a href="eventBasedAsynchronousPattern.html" class='link'>Event-based asynchronous</a> - Addresses problems with the asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.</li><li><a href="guardedSuspensionPattern.html" class='link'>Guarded suspension</a> - Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.</li><li><a href="joinPattern.html" class='link'>Join</a> - Join-pattern provides a way to write concurrent, parallel and distributed programs by message passing. Compared to the use of threads and locks, this is a high-level programming model.</li><li><a href="lockPattern.html" class='link'>Lock</a> - One thread puts a "lock" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.</li><li><a href="messagingDesignPattern.html" class='link'>Messaging design pattern</a> (MDP) - Allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications.</li><li><a href="monitorObjectPattern.html" class='link'>Monitor object</a> - An object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.</li><li><a href="reactorPattern.html" class='link'>Reactor</a> - A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously.</li><li><a href="readWriteLockPattern.html" class='link'>Read-write lock</a> - Allows concurrent read access to an object, but requires exclusive access for write operations.</li><li><a href="schedulerPattern.html" class='link'>Scheduler</a> - Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.</li><li><a href="threadPoolPattern.html" class='link'>Thread pool</a> - A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be considered a special case of the object pool pattern.</li><li><a href="threadSpecificStoragePattern.html" class='link'>Thread-specific storage</a> - Static or "global" memory local to a thread.</li></ul>
