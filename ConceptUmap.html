<p>Dimensionality Reduction using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) can be thoughtof as an extension of the PCA. It works towards a similar goal. But is a lot more efficient and accurate</p><p>Let us try to get an intuitive understanding of UMAP. It uses the concept of k-nearest neighbor and optimizes the results using stochastic gradient descent. It first calculates the distance between the points in high dimensional space, projects them onto the low dimensional space, and calculates the distance between points in this low dimensional space. It then uses Stochastic Gradient Descent to minimize the difference between these distances.</p><p>If we understand the concept, the Python implementation is trivial</p><pre><code class='python'>import umap
umap_data = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=5, min_dist=0.3, n_components=3).fit_transform(df[feat_cols][:6000].values)</code></pre>
